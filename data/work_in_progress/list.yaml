  abstract: >
      Does shortage of labor or abundance of labor encourage technology adoption? Are machines and men substitutes so that labor scarcity induces investment in technology, or are they complements so that availability of workers facilitates technology adoption? The project uses local labor supply shocks in Finland at the verge of industrialization to study how technology and labor supply interact. These shocks come from two sources: combat deaths and evacuations from invaded areas into designated towns during the Second World War, 1939â€“45. The project uses newly digitized local and plant-level data on technology use by type, employment, and organization. We find a positive effect of labor abundance on manufacturing development. Evidence on horsepower per person shows that additional labor does not crowd out capital but complements capital investment. Manufacturing employment share and gross value-added per person increase substantially across all identification strategies, including strategies based on military and evacuation plans.
