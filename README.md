**(Under construction!)**

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Applied Economics at Cornell University.

My current research focuses on studying the labor market power and its sources, such as threats from automation technologies, labor market policies, and foreign capital and trade liberalization in developed and developing countries. I am also interested in studying the effects of various economic and policy shocks on intrahousehold bargaining power and intimate partner violence in developing countries.

## Job Market Paper

**<strong style="font-size:16px;">[Automation Threat and Labor Market Power](https://tbyambasuren.github.io/papers/JMP/Byambasuren_JMP.pdf)</strong>**

Abstract: This paper studies the role of automation threat in the firm’s labor market power. Employing the production function approach, I estimate wage markdown to show that an average worker in German manufacturing receives 79 cents on the marginal euro. Using automation threat proxied by exposure of local labor market regions to industrial robots instrumented by plausibly exogenous shift-share factors, I find that automation threat increases markdowns over routine workers in areas with weaker labor protection in East Germany, which has spatial frictions. The key results are consistent with predictions from the wage bargaining model with heterogeneous workers where employers retain the “right-to-manage” their workforce composition. <br />

Abstract: How serious is indoor air pollution (IAP) as a threat to infants and children? This paper estimates the impact of cooking fuel choice – a predominant source of IAP – on under-five mortality in India, where reliance on biomass fuels such as firewood, animal dung, and agricultural waste is pervasive. Leveraging forest cover and agricultural land ownership for identification and nationally representative data, we find that solid fuel use for cooking significantly increases the child mortality rate - mainly driven by neonatal mortality in the first 28 days after birth. The mortality effect is higher for girls than boys and is magnified in relatively small households where there is limited scope for the division of labor between childcare and cooking responsibilities. Among polluting fuels, we find that biomass fuels drive the impact of polluting fuel use on child mortality.

Abstract: We propose a theory to show that a firm’s wage markdown, a measure of monopsony power—ratio of MRPL to wages, is a weighted average of markdowns over diﬀerent workers. We test the model using India's National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) program, which generates non-manufacturing jobs and potentially creates variation in workforce composition in manufacturing firms as a natural experiment. Consistent with the model predictions, we empirically find that the program leads to higher average wage markdowns at manufacturers by reducing the employment of mobile workers and leaving immobile workers withlow laborsupply elasticityemployed atmanufacturing firms. <br />

Abstract: This paper investigates the impacts of artisanal gold mining—the primary form of labor-intensive small-scale mining with hand tools—on intimate partner violence (IPV) against women in Sub-Saharan Africa, where female artisanal miners constitute a significant portion of the workforce. Exploiting cell-level spatial variation in gold suitability and an exogenous variation in international gold price for identification, we estimate the causal effects of artisanal gold mining conditional on industrial gold mines and other environmental shocks. Based on nationally representative data covering over 30 countries from the region, we find that less severe physical IPV experienced less frequently by women decreases mainly due to improvement in women’s bargaining power enhanced by an increase in their earning potential from extractive and sales or retail activities relative to husbands in response to the increased profitability of artisanal mining. The IPV-reducing short-run effects of artisanal gold mining, which are opposite from the impacts of industrial gold mining, tend to persist in the long term as its driving forces sustain over time. However, sexual IPV generally increases due to artisanal and industrial gold mining. <br />

**<strong style="font-size:16px;">Alcohol Ban and Intimate Partner Violence: Long-term Consequences of Policy Reversal</strong>** <br />
(with [Arnab K. Basu](https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/ab362/) and [Nancy H. Chau](https://sites.google.com/view/nancyhchau/home))

Abstract: This paper analyzes the short- and long-term effects of a partial liquor ban in Kerala, India, from 2014-2017 on women's experience with intimate partner violence (IPV). Leveraging neighbor states that are comparable and sufficiently isolated in our context as the comparison group, we employ difference-in-differences and event-study approaches to identify the causal effects of a policy that shuts down hard liquor-serving local bars. We find that the likelihood of experiencing physical IPV decreased during the policy period only in high-wealth households, the primary consumers of expensive hard liquors. However, physical IPV strongly rebounded after the policy reversal and overshot to a level higher than in the pre-policy period. We identify an implied change in the composition of household alcohol consumption before, during, and after the policy period and varying alcohol tolerance at different levels of alcohol intake as the underlying drivers of the intended and unintended impact of the temporary policy on physical IPV in the short and long term. <br />
