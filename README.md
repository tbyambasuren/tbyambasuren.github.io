<h2>Bio</h2>

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Applied Economics at Cornell University.

My current research focuses on studying the labor market power and its sources, such as threats from automation technologies, labor market policies, and foreign capital and trade liberalization in developed and developing countries. I am also interested in studying the effects of various economic and policy shocks on intrahousehold bargaining power and intimate partner violence in developing countries.

How serious is indoor air pollution (IAP) as a threat to infants and children? This paper estimates the impact of cooking fuel choice – a predominant source of IAP – on under-five mortality in India, where reliance on biomass fuels such as firewood, animal dung, and agricultural waste is pervasive. Leveraging forest cover and agricultural land ownership for identification and nationally representative data, we find that solid fuel use for cooking significantly increases the child mortality rate - mainly driven by neonatal mortality in the first 28 days after birth. The mortality effect is higher for girls than boys and is magnified in relatively small households where there is limited scope for the division of labor between childcare and cooking responsibilities. Among polluting fuels, we find that biomass fuels drive the impact of polluting fuel use on child mortality.</details>
