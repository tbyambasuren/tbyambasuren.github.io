I am an economist (PhD, [MIT](https://economics.mit.edu/)) and an Assistant Professor of Economics at [Stockholm University](https://www.su.se/department-of-economics/). I am also a Senior Fellow at [Etla](https://www.etla.fi/en/) and affiliated with [RFBerlin](https://www.rfberlin.com/) and [IZA](https://www.iza.org/).

My [research](/#workingpapers) focuses on technology, work, and psychology, using novel large-scale data. My latest work shows that firms adopting advanced technologies have increased employment, countering common concerns about the future of work.

My research has been widely featured in media outlets such as [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2022/01/22/economists-are-revising-their-views-on-robots-and-jobs), Wired, Bloomberg, and The Washington Post. My PhD thesis received the [Upjohn Institute Award](https://www.upjohn.org/2022-Dissertation-Awardees) and the main Finnish newspaper, HS, listed me in their [35 under 35](https://www.hs.fi/visio/art-2000007825436.html). I have also developed ETLAnow, a real-time forecasting tool that predicts unemployment trends using Google search data
